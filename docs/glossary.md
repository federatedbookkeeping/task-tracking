# Glossary
The terms below are used in the [Guide to System and Data Federation](./federation-guide.md) and other documents in this project.

## Federation
A group of systems which share data in peer to-peer transmissions where information flows from a node to its neighbours.  It ensures each individual node maintains sovereignty, thus being able to arbitrarily veto external accesses and modifications to its own data.

It is in essence a loose collection of systems that choose to support only those data formats and interaction protocols of systems that they wish to connect to, for their own benefit.
## Home System
Data are assumed to originate in one system, and be propagated to others via federation.  The system in which they originate is referred to as the Home System.
## Multi-Homed Data
This refers to data that are shared through federation, and that can be edited in more than system (either live or asynchronously).
## Live Data
This either means data propagated to other systems for edit upon being committed to the data store of their Home System, or data that can be edited in real-time in multiple applications.
## Identifier
A series of digits and/or characters that is used to uniquely identify an entity within one domain or system.
## Identity
Also called a Security Principal, this is the digital representation of a person, application service, or system that requires certain privileges for operating on data, with associated constraints on those privileges and audit of their use.
## System Sovereignty
This means the extent to which an application is in a position to determine access by other systems, including authorisations, and data formats, structures, and semantics.
## Data Sovereignty
The extent to which data created in one system can be exported from it or accessed from another systemm.
