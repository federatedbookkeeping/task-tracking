# Accessing Federation Demos
## Federation of Multiple Instances of the Same Application

The demo is available using the following links (registration is free):

[Tiki Timesheets](https://timesheet.dev4.evoludata.com)

and another similar Tiki instance here:

[Tiki Task-tracking](https://tasks.dev4.evoludata.com)

Use as follows:

1. Go to Tracker 6 on either of the instances.
1. Create a Task item there.
1. Open the tracker in the other instance and see the item has been federated.
1. Edit the item in any system and observe changes are propagated to the other Tiki instance.
1. Delete the item in one system to remove it from the other as well.

## Federation of Multiple Instances of Disparate Applications
The federation between multi-instance Tiki and Github (using BridgeBot) shows how issue-related data are federated between these disparate issue-tracking systems.

See the [BridgeBot repo's README file](https://github.com/federatedbookkeeping/bridgeBot) for details of how to use the demo.
