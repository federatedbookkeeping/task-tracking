Applications and data are tightly coupled: the format, structure, and meaning of data are almost inseparable from the application generating and using them, hindering the data's portability. Sharing data between applications entails mastering complex and proprietary APIs or export formats, and transforming output data into the necessary structure and meaning for use elsewhere, time-consuming and error-prone activities.

Federation is a way of linking different systems together so users can share data by being 'connected, but sovereign'. The precursor [Federated Timesheets project](https://github.com/federatedbookkeeping/timesheets) successfully pioneered this approach for time-tracking data, bringing together WikiSuite, timeld, and Prejournal such that timesheet data entered into one are easily disseminated to the others.

Federated Task-Tracking builds ambitiously on that foundation, with a more complex data model applicable to a broader range of real-world scenarios, introduces live collaborative editing of latency-critical data shared between participating systems.

This project is now getting under way - see the [NGI Assure proposal](./ngi-assure-application.md) for details of the plan.
