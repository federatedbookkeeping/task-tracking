In the spreadsheet 'Federated Task-tracking with Live Data' we have milestone 1: "Theoretical Groundwork and requirements analysis',
and within that milestone 1a: 'Definitions, Examples, Privacy and Security, Federation Protocol specification'

Of milestone 1a, 3000 euros went to work done by Manuel Esmenio, who studied the topic full-time (40 hours/week) during December 2022 and
part-time (20 hours/week) during January 2023. His findings were shared in the weekly Federated Bookkeeping conference call, as well
as in his [article](https://github.com/federatedbookkeeping/research/tree/main/Article) about the topic.

# Liquid Data
Another 4000 euros went to work done by Michiel de Jong and Navid Shokri, also studying the topic part-time (roughly 10 hours/week each)
during January-July 2023. The main outcome of these discussions was the invention of "[Liquid Data](https://michielbdejong.com/blog/30.html)" as a term for a CRDT that supports schema translations, as well as identifier mappings.

# LRI mapping
A main insight here as well was that the "Cool URIS don't change"
mantra of the WWW does not apply here, and instead of "Universal Resource Identifiers (URIs)" we need "Local Resource Identifiers (LRIs)" as our basic
building blocks.

Links to brainstorm documents, a slide deck, and a short blogpost are captured [here](https://github.com/federatedbookkeeping/task-tracking/issues/21#issuecomment-1964422453).

Apart from this, Angus McAllister and George Svarovski conducted their part of the fundamental research on this topic, for which they will send a separate RfP. This RfP is only for the work done by Manuel Esmenio, Michiel de Jong, and Navid Shokri.
